# Poker Stats Frontend

**Work in progress**

A React-based frontend for exploring poker hand statistics. This project will eventually allow users to search poker hands, view flop/turn/river results, and calculate hand odds. It is designed to integrate with a Spring Boot backend that manages poker hand data in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features (Planned)
- Search for specific poker hands
- Display results for flop, turn, and river
- Show most common hands and odds
- Filter and sort hand statistics
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

## Current Status
- Minimal frontend setup displaying a “Work in progress” message
- Backend endpoints exist but frontend integration is in progress

## Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js, JavaScript, CSS
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java) [planned integration]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL [planned integration]
